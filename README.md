# TODO
* Now we need to remember the word trails and red/grey numbers

* Stop using a Set, but instead have an object that is [word,path] and, somehow, choose randomly between the different paths to the same word to select only one. Then use that as the basis for red and grey numbers. 
* For each path, the first element is a red number increment and subsequent are grey
* Return the paths and words to the web page to manage (?)
* Store red/grey number stuff in saved results


If there are 3 identical words from different paths, keep one at random
